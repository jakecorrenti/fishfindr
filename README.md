# fishfindr

Fishfindr is an application that is being developed to help me figure out the best places to fish based on my catch history.

The front-end portion of the application sends my current location to the server when I catch a fish, and that data is stored in a SQLite DB. The goal is then to have a map interface that shows the clusters of where I catch the most fish at a given time.
